# OOS-report-compiler

The purpose of this program was to automate an archaic time consuming procedure of comparing out of specification (OOS) results at the end of each working day against each client's individual requirements and contact information. This required opening each client's OOS 
excel file, scrolling through vast amounts of unneccasary information, finding the results of interest and then comparing them to a separate file containing their reporting requirements, and a third file containing their contact info. This program automatically filters
the inforamtion, raises important or concerning results in various categories and displays all the information together in logical groupings.

Amongst the files, there is a folder containing fictional OOS reports called 'OOS results folder', and an excel file containing fictional contact information called 'Contact details'. The program will ask for the file paths to these items.
